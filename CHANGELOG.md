## Weil-étale cohomology and duality for arithmetic schemes in negative weights

### Version 2

Minor additions:

* fixed a couple of typos;

* explicitly stated comparison with l-adic cohomology in Corollary 5.7;

* comparison with Geisser's arithmetic homology in Proposition 7.9;

* remarks about the relation of L^c (X_ét, n) to standard
  Lichtenbaum's conjectures on finite generation of étale motivic
  cohomology at the beginning of section 8.

### Version 3

Minor additions:

* note that finiteness of H^i (X_ét, Z^c(n)) for X/F_q already follows from
  finite generation by duality,

* precise results on boundedness of H^i_W,c (X, Z(n)) in section 7,

* comparison with the construction of Flach and Morin in section 8.

### Version 4

* The new title is "Weil-étale cohomology and duality for arithmetic schemes
  in negative weights".

* Various improvements in the exposition thanks to suggestions
  of an anonymous referee, in particular in sec. 3 and 6.
